# [Covaccinfo](https://github.com/PKChionh/covaccinfo)

## Inspiration

With the release of vaccines for Covid-19, there is a need for quick and efficient vaccination of the population, in order to reach group immunity and reduce future viral mutations. 

## What it does

This web app enables the user to view the current Covid-19 statistics, distribution of Covid-19 vaccines, and search for locations of vaccination sites. There is also an interactive chatbot which can try to answer questions related to Covid-19 vaccination.

## How I built it

This project was built with KendoReact UI, for the Worthy Web App Challenge 2021 [https://progress-worthyweb.devpost.com](https://progress-worthyweb.devpost.com).
